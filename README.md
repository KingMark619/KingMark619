**Marco Kayumba**

You can call me King Mark. I always find it hard to describe myself. but I guess I can tell you about what I like to do.
I like travelling, and meeting new people. I like being outside of my comfort zone. I am a curious person. I like to share what I have learnt with others around me and vice versa.  I always try and find the balance between work and life. in order to continue enjoying the little things.
