Rethabile Segoe
You can call me Thabi for short. It's always difficult to describe yourself right? Well, I can tell you about what I like to do. I like travelling, and meeting new people. I like being outside of my comfort zone. I am a curious person at heart and you will usually find me researching something in my downtime. I like to share what I have learnt with others around me and vice versa. As someone who can easily lose myself in work, I am intentional about a work-life balance in order not to forget the sunshine outside.
